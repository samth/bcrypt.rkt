A Racket interface to bcrypt
===============================

This is derived from bcrypt interface from the Python 'cryptacular'
library by Daniel Holth, available here: https://bitbucket.org/dholth/cryptacular/

Includes the C sources for a version of `bcrypt`, which are compiled
as part of `raco setup bcrypt`. The version of bcrypt is by Solar Designer,
and is available here: http://www.openwall.com/crypt/

A C compiler is required at installation time, and is automatically found
by the `dynext` library.
